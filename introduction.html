    <p>Merry times around the holidays, right? Wrong, impeachment season it should be called; heck, i can only think of a single national news outlet covering the impeachment fairly! CNN is covering it with liberal bias, NBC is covering it with liberal bias, ABC is covering it with liberal bias, almost everything is covering it with liberal bias; except FOX News. </p>
